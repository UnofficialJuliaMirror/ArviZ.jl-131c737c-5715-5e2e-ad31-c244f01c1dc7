In ArviZ.jl, most of the same functions are exported and therefore called without the prefix (e.g. plot_posterior). The exception are from_xyz converters for packages that have no (known) Julia wrappers. These functions are not exported to reduce namespace clutter.","category":"page"},{"location":"#","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"ArviZ.jl transparently interconverts between arviz.InferenceData and our own InferenceData, used for dispatch.
